A place to stash my quantum computing experiments

## [Hadamard Basic](Hadamard%20Basic.qasm)

This is the simplest quantum circuit: a single input quibit goes through an Hadamard gate. The output is a qubit which if measured has a 50/50 chance to be a 0 or 1.

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform#Quantum_computing_applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform#Quantum_computing_applications)
for more details.
